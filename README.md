# ECE471, Reinforcement Learning
**Course Description** An introduction to the field of reinforcement learning (RL).
Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of fundamental RL concepts,
including Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo
methods, temporal-difference learning, and function approximation. The course
will cover both model-based and model-free RL algorithms, exploring their
theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and applications to real-world
problems. Through readings and assignments, students will develop the ability to
analyze, design, and implement RL agents for various tasks, building a deep
understanding of this machine learning paradigm.
